Feature Selection 
=================

The values selected for this summary come from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone database. 

Test and training datasets were merged and the features indicating mean() and str() of each measurement were extracted

Finally the dataset was grouped by Subject ID and Activity and the average of each of the features extracted were calculated

factors extracted and used in calculation are
